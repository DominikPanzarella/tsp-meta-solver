# Tsp-Meta-Solver

## Abstract
This project investigates the performance of various algorithms and heuristics on hard in-
stances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). The main goal is to perform a cross-
test comparison of exact solvers and approximate methods, analyzing their strengths and
weaknesses in dealing with particularly challenging problem instances.
The study covers classical algorithms such as Concorde and LKH3, as well as heuristics like
Nearest Neighbor and Christofides. Experimental results highlight the trade-offs between
solution quality and computational time, providing insights into the suitability of different
methods depending on instance characteristics.
This work contributes to the understanding of TSP solversâ€™ behavior on difficult inputs,
aiming to guide future research and practical applications in combinatorial optimization.
